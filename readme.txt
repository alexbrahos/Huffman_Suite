Huffman Suite

This program will take an input file called "clear.txt", compress it using a Huffman encoding, and then decompress it. Essentially, it runs the entire process used in a huffman encoding to demonstrate that all steps work.

This project was a school project, and as such it was on the school's Github, which cannot be forked to github.com. Because of this, all commits are lost in moving it over.
I worked on some of part 1, all of part 4, and I was the one who combined everyone else's work so that they work together. (converting all code to classes so another file can call them easily)
